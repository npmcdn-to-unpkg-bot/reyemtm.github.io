## About
***
My name is Malcolm Meyer, and I write about web maps, cartography, GIS and other spatially-related topics. I am also a [musician](http://malcolmmeyer.tumblr.com) and avid gardener. The name of the site comes from a commonly used function in web mapping. Here is a definition adapted from Leaflet:

<pre><code><strong>getBounds()</strong> Returns the LatLngBounds of the current map view, path or polyline</code></pre>

## Leaflet Plugins

## Comments

There are no comments on this site. I experimented with disqus and Google+ comments, but have decided leave the social interactions to social media.
