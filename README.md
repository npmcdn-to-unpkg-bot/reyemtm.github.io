##Clean Blog - Jekyll Version - Modified

This is a modified version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

Using Cloudflare this site can be viewed over ssl. Chrome alerts that fullscreen, which is key to viewing maps, will be depricated for http sites in the near future, hence the need for ssl. My only major modification is the related posts at the bottom of each post. Thanks to snazzymaps for the cool header.

Thanks

Malcolm
