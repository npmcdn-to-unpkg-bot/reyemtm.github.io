#Clean Blog by Start Bootstrap - Jekyll Version - Modified

This is a modified version of the Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

Using Cloudflare this site can be viewed over ssl. Chrome alerts that fullscreen, which is key to viewing maps, will be depricated for http sites in the near future, hence the need for ssl. My other modifications include the related posts at the bottom of each post, the menu, and the projects page. Thanks to snazzymaps for the cool header.
