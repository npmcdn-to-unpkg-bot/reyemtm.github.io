This is my take on a modern looking leaflet toolbar/ui. With leaflet-search as the base, and a few short lines of css, I have customized the .leaflet-top.leaflet-left class so that it shows a more elegant looking toolbar. Any additional tools could be added to any of the other leaflet positions, as those have all been left untouched. Additional tools could also be loaded via another button on the current toolbar, possibly a leaflet.easyButton with a tools icon, that when clicked reveals additional tools on the right for example.
